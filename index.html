        <h1>Emil's Webpage!</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Emil. This is my little webpage. I hope you like it. Also this proves that I can make a paragraph. I also know how to make words <strong>STRONK aka BOLD</strong>. Another skill of mine is that I can <em>italisizizie text</em></p>
        <h2>What I look like:</h2>
        <img src="./media/IMG_1524.jpg" alt="Emil's beautiful face" width="300">
        <p>Now, let me tell you all about the relationships between nested elements! (I'm using a separate paragraph to illustrate btw) It's really quite interesting. Basically, most elements have parents and children, as well as siblings. For example, this elements sibling element is the paragraph above, it's parent is the <strong>body</strong> element and it unfortunately has no children. Although you could say that <strong>this bold text right here</strong> is a child of the paragraph element.</p>
        <p>Okay. Now, it's time to test out how much I remember of list making. First I will make an ordered list, then an unordered one.</p>

To get some practice using lists, create a new HTML document and create the following lists:
An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods
An ordered list of todo’s you need to get done today
An unordered list of places you’d like to visit someday
An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies
